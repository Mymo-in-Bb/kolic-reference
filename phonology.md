Kolic also has one coarticulated fricative consonant /v͜ð/, represented by ⟨fð⟩ in the romanisation (and with the corresponding glyphs in the orthography). It is pronounced with the tip of the tongue, the the upper teeth, and the lower lip all in contact with each other. Throughout this document, it will instead be represented by the digraph /fð̯/ in phonemic transcriptions, for ease of writing.

Note that all consonants with the exception of m̥, n̥, ʃ, ç, x, ɣ, ɦ, and ɾ̥ have geminate forms, though
most of them aren't realised simply as geminates of the same phone. More in the [allophony](#consonant-allophony) section.

<a name="consonant-allophony" />
### Allophony

Geminates of a consonant are generally not realised straight-forwardly:

- /pː/ is realised as [ʰp]
- /bː/ is realised as [pː]
- /tː/ is realised as [ʰt]
- /dː/ is realised as [tː]
- /kː/ is realised as [ʰk]
- /gː/ is realised as [kː]
- /vː/ is realised as [fː]
- /ðː/ is realised as [θː]
- /ɾː/ is realised as [rː]
- /lː/ is realised as [ɬ]

Other allophonic variations:

- /k/ can be realised as [x] intervocalically (optionally)
- /g/ is realised as [ɣ] intervocalically
- /ɾ/ is realised as [ɾ̥] at the end of an utterance, before a pause and before unvoiced consonants.
- /ɾ/ and /ɾ̥/ can be realised as [r] and [r̥] (in free variation)
- /ŋ/ can sometimes be realised as [ŋg], especially if the speaker puts emphasis on the word or wants to articulate clearly.
- /f/ is realised as [v] intervocalically.

<a name="vowel-length" />
### Wowel length

Realised vowel length is very tightly coupled with syllable structure, described in the [syllable structure](#syllable-structure) section.

Vowels in monosyllabic words with either an open syllable, or ending in a single consonant (that is, not a geminate or a consonant cluster) can be pronounced long, or short in rapid speech (gär), unless they're a historically long vowel (indicated with an acute accent (á) or a vowel digraph (ää)), in which case they're always long (nú, kú, kól)

Vowels in word-final open syllables (jälgra, ýþa) are short.

Vowels in other open syllables are often pronounced as long, but can also be short in faster speech.

Vowels in other closed syllables are always short (hjappar, jölfar)

An exception to all of these rules are vowels followed by the digraphs ⟨gð⟩, ⟨fð⟩, ⟨ls⟩ and ⟨rs⟩, whose /g/, /l/ and /r/ sounds recently underwent elision (or coarticulation in the case of ⟨fð⟩), triggering compensatory lengthening in the preceding vowel. Therefore, any vowel before ⟨gð⟩, ⟨fð⟩, ⟨ls⟩ or ⟨rs⟩ is always pronounced long, even in rapid speech.

## Syllable structure
Kolic syllables follow a (F)(P)(N)(f)V(N)(F)(P)(P) syllable structure, where V are all vowels (including diphtongs), F are fricatives, P are plosives (stops), N are sonorants (nasals, taps/trills and approximants), and minuscule f are the non-sibilant fricatives /f/, /v/, /θ/, and /ð/. The two consecutive in the coda plosives may either be two different plosives (TODO: provide example), or a geminate plosive (þreitt) --- although these are not always realised as true geminate plosives (see the [consonant allophony](#consonant-allophony) section), they are nonetheless still analysed as such for the way they behave within the word.

Syllables of a word are always analysed in a way that minimises the coda --- that means that most often (as long as the phonotactic rules allow), geminates are analysed as one consonant in the coda, and one in the onset. (for example, hjappar is analysed as /çɑp.paɾ̥/, while hjapp is /çɑpp/). This has an effect on vowel length, more in the [vowel length](#vowel-length) section.

## Other phonotactic constraints

🚧 This section is a Work In Progress 🚧

Kolic displays a range of other phonotactic constraints:

- voiceless nasals and /ç/ (which is a voiceless counterpart to the approximant /j/) can only appear at the onset syllable boundary (that is, they can't be preceded by any other phone within a syllable). Note that this would also be the case with /ɬ/ --- the voiceless counterpart to /l/ --- except the geminate /lː/ evolved into the same sound, making this constraint not apply to /ɬ/ in that case.
- /ŋ/ can only appear in the coda, as it evolved as a slur between /n/ an /g/.
- /v/ and /f/ are generally allophonic, except in a word-initial position. Both phonemes underwent phonological changes that made them behave identically in all other environments. They are sometimes analysed separately for historical reasons, and sometimes

<a name="i-umlaut" />
### I-umlaut

🚧 This section is a Work In Progress 🚧

The vowel glyphs 〈i〉 and 〈í〉 trigger retrograde fronting most vowels found in the immediately preceding syllable. Mostly back and mid vowels are affected.
> 🛈 The reason this umlaut is triggered by the glyphs 〈i〉 and 〈í〉 and not simply the vowels /ɪ/ and /i/ is because of Kolic's historic spelling. Kolic's letters i, í, y, and ý used to represent four different phonemes --- /ɪ/, /ɪː/, /ɘ/, and /ɘː/ respectively. Kolic underwent this umalut triggered by /ɪ/, and then lost the distinction between front and near-front vowels, merging these two pairs (along with 〈e〉 and 〈ë〉).

The umlaut is no longer an active phonological process in Kolic. However, it's so prevalent in its fossilised form, that it warrants a thorough description. It's present in many roots (like kääri, originally kári), but more importantly, it is grammaticalised, meaning suffixes with a triggering nucleus still shift the vowels in the last syllable of the root (eg. kaevra (wave) → käëvri (waves), tanna (she goes) vs. tänni (he goes)). Note that younger affixes (such as direct object infixes) don't trigger the umlaut (therefore jäftar (to feel) keeps the 〈ä〉 when it becomes järiftar)

<a name="front-umlaut" />
### Front umlaut

🚧 This section is a Work In Progress 🚧

An ongoing phonological process in Kolic is a new form of umlaut, triggered by all front vowels. Unlike the i-umlaut, this one is prograde and only applies to some grammatical affixes clitics, not affecting roots.

Examples:

- "Aeraga ár ..." (is she...?) vs "Äërigä ór ..." (is he...?)
- "Kólra" (on the island) vs "Kyfðrä" (in the house)

## Vowel-triggered consonant mutation

🚧 This section is a Work In Progress 🚧

Historically front vowels (specifically vowels that were front after the i-umlaut, but before the i-y merger) lenite voiced stops /g/, /d/, and /b/ into approximants [j], [l] and [w], respectively. Because [w] only occurs in this environment as a variation of /b/, it is considered an allophone of /b/ and not its own phoneme.
